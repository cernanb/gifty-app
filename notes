1. Integrate basic theme
2. Allow users to CRUD items on lists
  - Receivers: Items on their Wish lists
  - Givers: Gift list: Selections that they have made from other users' lists
3. How it works
  Gift Givers
  - Givers search for a "Friend" to give to. They will be able to select friends and view their wish lists
  - Items can be selected to buy off of wish lists
  - Once a wish list item is selected, it must show up on the giver's list/home page, yet be available to other users if they want to purchase it
    - Then can go in and mark that item as purchased
  - Once an item is purchased, it should be removed from other users "to-buy" lists and shown as purchased on the receiver's list
Gift Receivers
- Can make a list of items
- The item remains on the Receiver's wish list until a Giver marks it as purchased, where it is "crossed out"
- Should know that their gift has been purchased yet not be confused by item's status


Remaining:

- HTML/CSS! Define layout and classes
- Replace lost figaro file
- See if I can use helper methods in views to reduce logic

Nice to have/next version/future versions:
  - Authorizations
  - Add tests
  - Add more seed data for wish lists
  - Add ability to undo deletions
  - Item model: resolve issues around validates_uniqueness_of :name
    - notice for entering duplicate items
    - collection_select box/dropdown to select items to lists (involves making a new list_item)
    - ability to enter in items that have been deleted from list_items/user wish lists
  - Identify callbacks that would be helpful
  - User profiles - Either based on FB/Social Media profiles
  - Authentication from additional platforms
  - Test friend search in side bar, consider using cells gem
  - Add placeholder text in list_item details text area
  - Most popular/trending items
    - Build class level method
    - Place in sidebar

Bugs found:
1. Logging in or signing up via Omniauth brings user to .../home#_=_ rather than the clean .../home url. This bug is not present when logging in via email.
2. Search does not alphabetize usernames created via omniauth.
