1. Integrate basic theme
2. Allow users to CRUD items on lists
  - Receivers: Items on their Wish lists
  - Givers: Gift list: Selections that they have made from other users' lists
3. How it works
  Gift Givers
  - Givers search for a "Friend" to give to. They will be able to select friends and view their wish lists
  - Items can be selected to buy off of wish lists
  - Once a wish list item is selected, it must show up on the giver's list/home page, yet be available to other users if they want to purchase it
    - Then can go in and mark that item as purchased
  - Once an item is purchased, it should be removed from other users "to-buy" lists and shown as purchased on the receiver's list
Gift Receivers
- Can make a list of items
- The item remains on the Receiver's wish list until a Giver marks it as purchased, where it is "crossed out"
- Should know that their gift has been purchased yet not be confused by item's status


Remaining:
1. Include a class level ActiveRecord scope method (model object & class method name and URL to see the working feature e.g. User.most_recipes URL: /users/most_recipes)
2. Include form display of validation errors (form URL e.g. /recipes/new) - Ensure that there is adequate outside of authentication
3. See if I can use helper methods in views to reduce logic
4. Delete unused routes
5. Delete unused controllers
6. See about alphabetizing search
7. See if callbacks would be helpful
8. HTML/CSS! Define layout and classes
9. Nice to have/next version:
    - authorizations
    - Item model: resolve issues around validates_uniqueness_of :name
      - notice for entering duplicate items
      - collection_select box/dropdown to select items to lists (involves making a new list_item)
      - ability to enter in items that have been deleted from list_items/user wish lists
    - 

Bugs found:
1. Logging in or signing up via Omniauth brings user to .../home#_=_ rather than the clean .../home url. This bug is not present when logging in via email.
2. Search does not alphabetize usernames created via omniauth.
