1. Integrate basic theme
2. Allow users to CRUD lists
  - In Receiver role: Wish list
  - In Giver role: Gift list

Users can select items from other users' wish lists and check off items when they are purchased/ (Receivers) see what has been purchased. In sum, it functions as a registry and shopping list app.

A Giver will search for a person to give to. They will be able to select a Receiver and view the Receiver's wish list.
- When the Giver decides they want to buy an item, they check that they want to buy this item.
  - This mark should be viewable only to the Giver.
  - The item then goes on the Giver's "list."
  - The Giver must select a location to buy from.
    - Givers can either select from a list of existing stores which carry that item or find_or_create a new store.
  - The item will default as "not purchased"; a checkbox can toggle the boolean.
  - Giver will check the box when an item is purchased.

  - The item will be viewed on the Giver's Home page per store.


A Receiver will make a list of items - they don't care what store they come from.
- The item remains on the Receiver's wish list until a Giver marks it as purchased.
